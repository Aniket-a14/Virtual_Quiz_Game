# Virtual_Quiz_Game

Hey guys!! It's Aniket a.k.a Wizard 
and this is a project that me and my team members created for hackathon for children of range 8-13 years of age
Our project is based on the problem that these children are highly exposed to the evil of today's world, so to aware them about their legal rights and teach them about what is right or wrong but make them play a quiz game
We have used python along with different libraries like
-Pygame
-CVzone
-CV2
-mediapipe

Our game using use real time hand-gestures and will give the quiz answers instantly
We are all first-year college students so we don't have much idea about tensorflow, keras etc. so to make a raw code, but I hope we will be able to do better in our upcoming stages of our life
Thank you!
